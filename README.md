Python-Challenge 

In this challenge I worked on two exercises; PyBank and Pypoll. 

In PyBank I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. I was given a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. 

In PyPoll I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process. I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate.
